Welcome! I am a Ph.D. student in Economics at the University of Connecticut. My research interests lie in **international finance**, **exchange rate dynamics**, and **macroeconomics**. Prior to this, I earned my M.A. in International Economics and Finance from Johns Hopkins University (SAIS) and my B.A. in Economics from UC Davis, including an exchange program at Peking University.

I have worked as a Research Associate at CUHK (Shenzhen) and as a sell-side analyst in Beijing. I’m currently a teaching assistant at UConn, and I have also assisted undergraduate economics courses in China.
